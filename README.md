Here is a code snippet in Python that provides a simple encryption software. This code snippet prompts the user to enter a message and encrypts it. The encryption process is carried out using the Fernet encryption algorithm. This code snippet has been developed using an open-source library called cryptography.

# **How to Use**
Install the "cryptography" library:
> pip install cryptography

# **Requirements**
The cryptography library is required for this code to work. You can install the library by running the following command:
> pip install cryptography

# **Disclaimer**
This code is for demonstration purposes only and may not provide sufficient security levels for real-world applications. Before using secure encryption methods, it is recommended to consult with a cryptography expert to meet your security requirements.
